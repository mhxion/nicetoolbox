    Logs the configurations to a file.

    The function takes in a dictionary of configurations, an output folder path, and an
    optional file name. It fills in placeholders in the code_config dictionary with
    actual values using the config_fill_auto function. Then, it constructs the log file
    path by joining the output folder path and the file name with a .toml extension.
    After that, it updates the configs dictionary with the filled code_config and saves
    the configurations to the log file using the save_config function.

        configs (dict): A dictionary containing the configurations to be logged.
        out_folder (str): The path to the output folder where the log file will be
            saved.
