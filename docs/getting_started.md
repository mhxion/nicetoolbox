## 1. Machine-specific and project configs

Configuration is split across two files: one machine-specific and one project-specific.

**`machine_specific_paths.toml`** — lives in the toolbox root, contains machine-level paths. Generate it with `make create_machine_specifics`:

```toml
# Where to find your conda (miniconda or anaconda) installation as absolute path (str)
conda_path = 'path/to/your/conda'
```

**`nice_project.toml`** — lives in your project folder, contains project-level paths. It is generated with `make create_project`:

```toml
# Path to the directory in which all configuration files are stored
configs_folder_path = '<project_folder_path>/configs'

# Path to the directory in which all datasets are stored
datasets_folder_path = '../datasets'

# Directory for saving toolbox output
output_folder_path = '../outputs'
```

Adjust `datasets_folder_path` and `output_folder_path` as needed for your setup.

## 2. Example dataset

We provide an example dataset called `communication_multiview` to demonstrate the NICE Toolbox's capabilities. Please find it in the `datasets` folder specified above.

## 3. Check the dataset's properties

Ensure that `./configs/dataset_properties.toml` contains the following dictionary:

```toml
[communication_multiview]
session_IDs = ["session_xyz"]
sequence_IDs = ['']
cam_front = 'view_center'
cam_top = 'view_top'
cam_face1 = 'view_left'
cam_face2 = 'view_right'
subjects_descr = ["person_left", "person_right"]
cam_sees_subjects = {view_center = [0, 1], view_top = [0, 1], view_left = [0], view_right = [1]}
path_to_calibrations = "<datasets_folder_path>/communication_multiview/calibrations.npz"
data_input_folder = "<datasets_folder_path>/communication_multiview/<cur_session_ID>/"
start_frame_index = 0
fps = 30
```

A detailed description of this file can be found in the wiki page on config files under [dataset properties](wikis/wiki_config_files.md#dataset-properties).

## 4. Add an experiment to run

To run the NICE toolbox on the dataset, we need to specify what exactly we want to run in our experiment. Open `./configs/detectors_run_file.toml` and ensure that the `[run]` dictionary includes the following:

```toml
[run]
[run.communication_multiview]
components = ["body_joints", "gaze_individual", "gaze_interaction", "kinematics", "proximity", "leaning", "emotion_individual", "head_orientation"]
videos = [
   {session_ID = "session_xyz", sequence_ID='', video_start = 0, video_length = 99},
]

```

More details can be found in the wiki page on config files under [run file](wikis/wiki_config_files.md#run-file).

## 5. Run the NICE Toolbox

To run the toolbox, open a terminal and execute:

```bash
# navigate to the NICE toolbox source code folder
cd /path/to/nicetoolbox/

# LINUX: activate the environment 
source ./envs/nicetoolbox/bin/activate

# WINDOWS: activate the environment TODO: update
envs\nicetoolbox\Scripts\activate

# run the toolbox
run_detectors
```

The outputs will be saved in the folder defined in `./configs/detectors_run_file.toml` under `io.out_folder` (with filled-in placeholders).
To monitor the experiment, check the log file at `/path/to/<out_folder>/nicetoolbox.log`. The tool is expected to take approximately 6 minutes for this experiment.

## 6. Visualize the results

There are multiple options to visualize the results of NICE toolbox.
For an interactive experience, we recommend using our `visual` code, which runs `rerun`.
To do so, open `./configs/visualizer_config.toml` and update the entries `io.experiment_folder`, `io.dataset_name`, and `io.video_name`.

```toml
[io]
dataset_folder = "<datasets_folder_path>"                                 # main dataset folder
dataset_name = 'communication_multiview'                                  # dataset of the video
video_name = 'communication_multiview_session_xyz_s0_l99'                 # name of video result folder
nice_tool_input_folder = "<output_folder_path>/nicetoolbox_input/<cur_dataset_name>_<cur_session_ID>_<cur_sequence_ID>"
experiment_folder = "<output_folder_path>/experiments/..."                 # NICE Toolbox experiment output folder
experiment_video_folder = "<experiment_folder>/<video_name>"
experiment_video_component = "<experiment_video_folder>/<component_name>"
```

A detailed description of visualizer configuration can be found in the wiki page on config files under [visualizer config](wikis/wiki_config_files.md#visualizer-config).

Finally, from the top level of your code folder, start the visualizer by running

```bash
# activate the python environment if not already activated
source ./envs/nicetoolbox/bin/activate # LINUX
envs\nicetoolbox\Scripts\activate # WINDOWS

# run the visualizer
run_visualization
```

It will open a window which looks similar to this:

## 7. Run the NICE Toolbox Evaluation

While doing research, you often would like to check the quality and consistency of NICE Toolbox output. We can run an evaluation pipeline to generate additional metrics reports for your data (with and without ground truth annotations). The results can be used to tune specific detector parameters, relevant for your domain.

To run the evaluation of the NICE Toolbox on the example dataset, open a terminal and execute:

```bash
# navigate to the NICE toolbox source code folder
cd /path/to/nicetoolbox/

# Activate the environment with LINUX: 
source ./envs/nicetoolbox/bin/ac

# Activate the environment with WINDOWS:
envs\nicetoolbox\Scripts\activate

# run the evaluation
run_evaluation
```

The outputs will be saved to the folder defined in `./configs/evaluation_config.toml` under `io.output_folder` (with filled-in placeholders). To monitor the experiment, check the log file at `/path/to/output_folder/evaluation.log`.

Please refer to the tutorial on [NICE Toolbox Evaluation](tutorials/tutorial5_evaluation.md) for more details about metric selection and summary generation. Under the wiki pages there is an [overview](wikis/wiki_evaluation_metrics.md) of the available metrics to select from. For more data driven analysis based on raw metric results, please check out our [evaluation results wrapper](tutorials/tutorial6_results_wrapper.md) for easy querying, aggregation or export and Pandas Dataframe.
